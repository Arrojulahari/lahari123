    <ul style="font-size:20px; font-weight:30px; color:black;"><li>For the first time, Engineers Day in India was celebrated on September 15, 1968, to mark the birth anniversary of Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya.</li>
         <li>Since then, this day has been observed annually to honour the pivotal role that engineers play in shaping the world around us.</li>
         </ul>
         <h1 style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;color:green">Significance of Engineer's Day!</h1>
         <p style="background-color:black;color:antiquewhite;width: 400px;">The significance of Engineers Day in India lies in its recognition of the invaluable role engineers play in shaping the nation’s progress and infrastructure.</p>
         <h1 style="background-color: antiquewhite;color:purple;display:inline">Contributions of Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya</h1>
         <div><ol><font size="4px">
            <li style="color: red;">Irrigation Projects</li><marquee><p id="hi"> His pioneering work in irrigation projects revolutionised agriculture in India. One of his most significant accomplishments in this realm was the design and construction of the Krishna Raja Sagara Dam, located on the Cauvery River near Mysore. This massive dam not only controlled the river’s flow but also harnessed its waters for irrigation purposes. The impact of this project was transformative. It turned once-arid regions into fertile lands, leading to increased agricultural productivity and prosperity for the local populace. </p></marquee><br>
            <li style="color: blue;">Education and Research</li><p id="bi">Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya recognised the pivotal role education and research play in a nation’s progress. To this end, he played a pivotal role in establishing the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) in Bangalore in 1909. 

            IISc, India’s premier institution for scientific and technological research, stands as a living testament to its commitment to fostering scientific advancements. Under his guidance, IISc became a hub for groundbreaking research in various disciplines, including physics, chemistry, and engineering. His vision of nurturing a culture of innovation and scientific inquiry laid the foundation for India’s future as a technological powerhouse.</p><br>
            <li style="color: brown;">Economic Planning</li><p id="ni">Beyond engineering and education, he displayed remarkable foresight in the realm of economic planning. His seminal work, “Planned Economy for India,” outlined a comprehensive roadmap for the nation’s economic development. It emphasised the importance of planned industrialisation, infrastructure development, and resource management. His ideas and recommendations laid the groundwork for India’s Five-Year Plans and played a pivotal role in shaping the nation’s economic policies. His holistic approach to economic planning anticipated the needs of India, which was growing as a country, and provided a strategic framework for balanced and sustainable growth.</p><br>
            <li style="color: aqua;">Honours and Awards</li><p id="ki">Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya’s outstanding contributions were not confined to the boundaries of India; they received global recognition. In the year 1955, he was honoured with the Bharat Ratna in recognition of his exceptional service to the nation. This prestigious accolade celebrated his contributions not only as an engineer but also as an educator, economist, and visionary leader. Additionally, he received honorary doctorates and awards from universities and institutions worldwide, further underscoring his status as a global luminary in the fields of engineering, economics, and public service.</p></font>

                <p>civil engineering, the profession of designing and executing structural works that serve the general public, such as dams, bridges, aqueducts, canals, highways, power plants, sewerage systems, and other infrastructure. The term was first used in the 18th century to distinguish the newly recognized profession from military engineering, until then preeminent. From earliest times, however, engineers have engaged in peaceful activities, and many of the civil engineering works of ancient and medieval times—such as the Roman public baths, roads, bridges, and aqueducts; the Flemish canals; the Dutch sea defenses; the French Gothic cathedrals; and many other monuments—reveal a history of inventive genius and persistent experimentation.</p>

            <p> Electricity is the basic need for survival of human beings globally. From household to industrial plants, Communication Satellite Navigation system, Electronic equipment and Computers etc., all require electricity. Electrical engineering is one of the core fields of engineering, always evergreen in terms of scope and job prospects. Electrical Engineering is the heart of whole engineering discipline. Electrical & Electronics Engineering(EEE) is a branch which has interface with all spheres of life covering generation of Electrical Power and associated manufacturing activities in all industries like Steel, Automobile, Traction, Renewable energy and Communication etc.
                The EEE branch has boundless career openings in terms of jobs, self-employment and higher studies. Power generation, transmission and distribution, maintenance of electrical drives and control are the potential zone of work for EEE engineers. Due to the increasing demand of green environment renewable energy field is likewise a promising sector which has numerous opportunities. In automation sector also the demand of electric vehicles and smart manufacturing techniques used in the industries has increased the scope of the branch. Alternatively student can also opt to become certified Energy Auditor and Energy Manager by qualifying the exams conducted by the government.</p>
